        - doc fixes (bug #18100)
        - META.yml is not written by hand anymore
        - added a test for POD coverage
        - this version removes this distribution from
          the twilight zone created by being a development
          version - I don't know exactly why: maybe I just
          felt that after two years it should be promoted.

        - confessed the Unicode bug 
        - added dependencies on Test::More and Carp
        - docs now mention the distribution 'version'
